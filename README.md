# HadoopBlast
In this project, a blend of Hadoop statistical analysis and hadoop map-reduce has been implemented by a parallel version of 
BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool: http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) using the programming interfaces
of the Hadoop MapReduce framework. This application is written in "Map-Only" fashion.
